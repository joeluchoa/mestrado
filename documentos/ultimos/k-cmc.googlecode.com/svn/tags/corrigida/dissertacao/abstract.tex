We consider a long-studied generalization of the shortest path problem,
in which not one but several short paths must be produced.
The $k$-shortest (simple) paths problem is to list the $k$ paths 
connecting a given source-destination pair in the digraph with minimum total length.

This dissertation deals with $k$-shortest simple paths algorithms 
designed for non-negative costs, undirected graphs and 
some implementations of them.

\noindent \textbf{Keywords:} shortest paths, $k$-shortest paths.
