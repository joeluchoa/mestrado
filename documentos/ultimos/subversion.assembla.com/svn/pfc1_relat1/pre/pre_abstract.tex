\begin{abstract}{The Shortest Path Problem with Forbidden Paths of Length Two}
This project aims at studying the Shortest Path Problem with Forbidden Paths of Length Two addressing some variations of this problem and the relationship between them. Some solutions already proposed will be studied, new models will be presented and compared in order to allow choosing the best algorithm for each specific case of use. As primary target, this work aims to find the solution that best fits the problem of choosing the shortest path in a mesh of urban traffic.
