This directory contains spbad.c, a generator of random hard graph instances 
for Dijkstra's SSP algorithm. (It uses random.c). The generator produces 
many decrease-key operations.  Output is in extended DIMACS graph format, 
which is compatible with SPLIB.  For details, see: 

    A. V. Goldberg and R. E. Tarjan, ``Expected performance of Dijkstra's
            shortest path algorithm,''  Tech. Report No. 96--062, NECI 
            1996.

To compile, type

      gcc -O4  -o spbad  spbad.c -lm

Usage is  

       spbad #n #d -s#i     where #n is the number of nodes
                                  #d is node degree
                                  #i is a random seed

For the DIMACS Challenge 5, Goldberg recommends problem families
with constant degree (say 10) and degree n/2.
