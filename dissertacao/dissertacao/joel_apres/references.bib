  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is a
    generalization of the vehicle routing problem where the service of a
      customer can begin within the time window defined by the earliest and
      the latest times when the customer will permit the start of service. In
      this paper, we present the development of a new optimization algorithm for
      its solution. The LP relaxation of the set partitioning formulation of the
      VRPTW is solved by column generation. Feasible columns are added as needed
      by solving a shortest path problem with time windows and capacity
      constraints using dynamic programming. The LP solution obtained generally
      provides an excellent lower bound that is used in a branch-and-bound
      algorithm to solve the integer set partitioning formulation. Our results
      indicate that this algorithm proved to be successful on a variety of
      practical sized benchmark VRPTW test problems. The algorithm was capable of
      optimally solving 100-customer problems. This problem size is six times
      larger than any reported to date by other published research.},

      second problem, we minimize the generalized cost subject to a constraint on
      the bottleneck. In the third problem, we consider the two criteria
      simultaneously and find all the Pareto optimum solutions. The major result
      is that the introduction of the bottleneck measure changes the complexity
      of the original (general cost) problem by a factor which is at most linear
      in the number of links.},

  abstract ={The multicommodity network-flow model concerns routing of a number of commodities through a capacitated network at minimal cost. In the basic model, it is assumed that for each commodity, the flow can be routed on any path connecting its origin and its destination. In telecommunication applications, where a commodity represents a communication pair, there are often additional time-delay or reliability requirements on paths that are used for routing. These requirements may vary by communication pair, represented by different priority classes. In this paper, we extend the basic multicommodity network-flow model to include such side constraints on paths. The extended problem is NP-hard with the constrained shortest-path problem as a special case. To solve the extended model, we use a column-generation approach, in which the solution is built up successively by path generation. The side constraints are efficiently handled in the path-generation subproblem. We further discuss various enhancements of this approach. Computational results show that the column-generation approach provides an efficient way for solving the extended model, even for fairly large networks.},

  abstract = {The crew scheduling problem (CSP) appears in many mass transport systems (e.g., airline, bus, and railway industry) and consists of scheduling a number of crews to operate a set of transport tasks satisfying a variety of constraints. This problem is formulated as a set partitioning problem with side constraints (SP), where each column of the SP matrix corresponds to a feasible duty, which is a subset of tasks performed by a crew. We describe a procedure that, without using the SP matrix, computes a lower bound to the CSP by finding a heuristic solution to the dual of the linear relaxation of SP. Such dual solution is obtained by combining a number of different bounding procedures. The dual solution is used to reduce the number of variables in the SP in such a way that the resulting SP problem can be solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Computational results are given for problems derived from the literature and involving from 50 to 500 tasks.},

  abstract = {A technique is presented for the decomposition of a linear program that permits the problem to be solved by alternate solutions of linear sub-programs representing its several parts and a coordinating program that is obtained from the parts by linear transformations. The coordinating program generates at each cycle new objective forms for each part, and each part generates in turn (from its optimal basic feasible solutions) new activities (columns) for the interconnecting program. Viewed as an instance of a 'generalized programming problem' whose columns are drawn freely from given convex sets, such a problem can be studied by an appropriate generalization of the duality theorem for linear programming, which permits a sharp distinction to be made between those constraints that pertain only to a part of the problem and those that connect its parts. This leads to a generalization of the Simplex Algorithm, for which the decomposition procedure becomes a special case. Besides holding promise for the efficient computation of large-scale systems, the principle yields a certain rationale for the 'decentralized decision process' in the theory of the firm. Formally the prices generated by the coordinating program cause the manager of each part to look for a 'pure' sub-program analogue of pure strategy in game theory, which he proposes to the coordinator as best he can do. The coordinator finds the optimum 'mix' of pure sub-programs (using new proposals and earlier ones) consistent with over-all demands and supply, and thereby generates new prices that again generates new proposals by each of the parts, etc. The interative process is finite.},

  abstract = {Two shortest route models for determining where to allocate inspection effort on a production line are developed for the cases where this effort is unlimited or limited in its availability. A production line is defined as an ordered sequence of production stages, each stage consisting of a manufacturing operation followed by a potential inspection station. Items flow through the line in batches and may incur defects at any stage. Defects are assumed to be repairable or non-repairable. The defect generating process at any stage is taken to be an independent Bernoulli process with a known parameter. Two levels of inspection effort may be applied at any stage: no inspection or 100% inspection. Thus, both models are used to determine the stages at which batches are to be 100% inspected. A general cost structure is postulated first for the case where items with repairable defects are immediately repaired and items with non-repairable defects are discarded, and then for the case where all items found to be defective are replaced immediately with non-defectives. An expected cost per batch criterion is used to determine an optimal inspection plan in all cases. Examples are included.},

The relaxation is restricted to the set of arcs that are likely to be saturated at the optimum. This set is itself approximated by an active set strategy. The partial Lagrangian dual is solved with Proximal-ACCPM, a variant of the analytic center cutting-plane method. The new approach makes it possible to solve huge problems when few arcs are saturated at the optimum, as appears to be the case in many practical problems.},

Three of these variants, one for negative arc lengths, but without negative cycles, and two for nonnegative arc lengths, augment the PSP algorithm to maintain a property called sharp by Shier and Witzgall. The other three variants augment the PSP algorithm to maintain a property called near-sharp for nonnegative arc lengths. Extensive computational testing is presented on one of the sharp variants for nonnegative arc lengths and two of the near-sharp variants. The empirical results based on 4500 test problems with 90 different configurations and three different network topologies indicate that these new algorithms have excellent computational performance characteristics. Based on total solution times for the 4500 test problems, these new algorithms out-perform all other algorithms tested. In addition, one of the near-sharp algorithms strictly dominates all others on all problem topologies tested.},

The approach that theoretically yields the system-optimal traffic pattern may discriminate against some users in favor of others. Proposed alternate models, however, do not directly address the system perspective and may result in inferior performance. We propose a novel model and corresponding algorithms to resolve this dilemma. We present computational results on real-world instances and compare the new approach with the well-established traffic assignment model. The essence of this study is that system-optimal routing of traffic flow with explicit integration of user constraints leads to a better performance than the user equilibrium, while simultaneously guaranteeing superior fairness compared to the pure system optimum.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for finding the K loopless paths that have the shortest lengths from one node to another node in a network. The significance of the new algorithm is that its computational upper bound increases only linearly with the value of K. Consequently, in general, the new algorithm is extremely efficient as compared with the algorithms proposed by Bock, Kantner, and Haynes [2], Pollack [7], [8], Clarke, Krikorian, and Rausan [3], Sakarovitch [9] and others. This paper first reviews the algorithms presently available for finding the K shortest loopless paths in terms of the computational effort and memory addresses they require. This is followed by the presentation of the new algorithm and its justification. Finally, the efficiency of the new algorithm is examined and compared with that of other algorithms.},
